# SQL-Project-ETL-and-Building-a-Schema
Founded in 1990, Blue Sky Online is an online consumer electronic retailer conducting online business across UK and Europe through several outlets including its own website, Amazon, eBay, and Tesco. Presently, the company offers a range of products in more than 500 brands nearly prearranged in ten categories.
 
However, the dynamic and highly competitive nature of consumer electronics have led to different decision-making challenges to pricing, targeting high value customers, consumer satisfaction and product offerings. Due to a high customer base across the UK and Europe, marketing and customer relationship managers couldn’t utilise the customer base since it is not maintained properly with important information missing, and customer details and transactions managed by different applications such as spreadsheet and google docs. 
 
The company aims to manage and analyse customer interactions to improve its business relationships with customers, facilitate customer retention and drive sale growth. 
To meet the company’s aims, a dimensional data model will be designed, and a data warehouse built where we execute SQL queries to create and populate fact and dimension tables.
However, the implemented data warehouse should combine customer information and sale transactions into a central corporate repository so that managers can produce reports and do analysis that would enable them to give useful information for their decision-making activities.
